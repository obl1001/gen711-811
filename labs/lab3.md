6. Enter your RON password when prompted
7. You should see an 'open folder' on the left. Click it. The command prompt will have something like ```/home/unhAW/jtmiller/```. Click 'ok' open your home directory. If you saved a lab notebook to RON, you should see it on the left in a list of files. Click on it to open it. 
8. Next, we need to clone your gen711-811 github repo that you forked. Skip this step if you have done this already. If not, paste it into your lab notebook with <YOURGITHUBUSERNAME> replaced with your  username 
```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/<YOURGITHUBUSERNAME>/gen711-811.git
```
9. Finally, we need to pull the latest updates to this repo. Run these commands:
```
cd gen711-811
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jthmiller/gen711-811.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master
cd ~
```
